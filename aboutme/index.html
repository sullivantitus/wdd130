    <p>Hello everybody! I'm a Computer Science major from South Carolina. I was born there, and after 15 long years of consistent travel, wound up back in SC until college.</p>
    <p>I really enjoy to read, play video games, and play D&D with friends!</p>
    <p>I'm still learing all things coding and programming, but I'm hoping to improve as the year goes on!</p>
